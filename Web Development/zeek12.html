    <h1>SEMANTIC TAGS</h1>

    A semantic element clearly describes its meaning to both the browser and the developer. Examples of nonsemantic
    elements: &lt;div&gt; and &lt;span&gt; Tells nothing about its content. Examples of semantic elements: &lt;form&gt;,
    &lt;table&gt;, and &lt;article&gt; Clearly defines its content.

    Some of the benefits from writing semantic markup are as follows:
    <ol>
        <li> Search engines will consider its contents as important keywords to influence the page's search rankings
            (see
            SEO)</li>
        <li>Screen readers can use it as a signpost to help visually impaired users navigate a page</li>
        <li> Finding blocks of meaningful code is significantly easier than searching through endless divs with or
            without
            semantic or namespaced classes</li>
        <li>Suggests to the developer the type of data that will be populated</li>
        <li> Semantic naming mirrors proper custom element/component naming</li>
    </ol>
