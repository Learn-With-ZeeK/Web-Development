        <h1>Introduction to JavaScript  frontend and backend</h1>
        <p><strong>What is JavaScript and why it is used?</strong>
            JavaScript is a text-based programming language used both on the client-side and server-side that allows you
            to make web pages interactive. Where HTML and CSS are languages that give structure and style to web pages,
            JavaScript gives web pages interactive elements that engage a user.</p>
        <p><strong>What does DOM mean in JavaScript? </strong>

            The Document Object Model (DOM) is an application programming interface (API) for valid HTML and well-formed
            XML documents. It defines the logical structure of documents and the way a document is accessed and
            manipulated</p>
        <p> <strong>What is Java vs JavaScript?</strong>
            Key differences between Java and JavaScript: Java is an OOP programming language while Java Script is an OOP
            scripting language. Java creates applications that run in a virtual machine or browser while JavaScript code
            is run on a browser only. Java code needs to be compiled while JavaScript code are all in text.</p>
        <p><strong>What does AJAX do in JavaScript?</strong>
            AJAX stands for Asynchronous JavaScript And XML. In a nutshell, it is the use of the XMLHttpRequest object
            to communicate with servers. It can send and receive information in various formats, including JSON, XML,
            HTML, and text files.</p>
        <p><strong>What can in-browser javascript do ?</strong>
            In-browser JavaScript can do everything related to webpage manipulation, interaction with the user, and the
            webserver. For instance, in-browser JavaScript is able to: Add new HTML to the page, change the existing
            content, modify styles. React to user actions, run on mouse clicks, pointer movements, key presses</p>
        <p> <strong>What can't in browser JavaScript do?</strong> <strong>or </strong>
            <strong> What JavaScript Can't Do </strong>
            JavaScript does not allow the reading or writing of files on client machines. ...
            JavaScript does not allow the writing of files on server machines. ...
            JavaScript cannot close a window that it hasn't opened. ...
            JavaScript cannot read information from an opened Web page that came from another server.
        </p>
        <p><strong>Is JavaScript in browser safe? </strong>
            JavaScript is "relatively safe," but not "absolutely safe." Any code you run on your system has a potential
            to do harm. There is no perfectly safe system, except for the one that never used.</p>
        <p><strong>What makes javascript unique?</strong>
            Advantages of JavaScript
            Speed. Client-side JavaScript is very fast because it can be run immediately within the client-side browser.
            ...
            Simplicity. JavaScript is relatively simple to learn and implement.
            Popularity. ...
            Interoperability. ...
            Server Load.  ...
            Gives the ability to create rich interfaces.</p>
            <p><strong>What does node do in JavaScript?</strong>
                Node (or more formally Node. js) is an open-source, cross-platform runtime environment that allows developers to create all kinds of server-side tools and applications in JavaScript. The runtime is intended for use outside of a browser context (i.e. running directly on a computer or server OS)</p>
